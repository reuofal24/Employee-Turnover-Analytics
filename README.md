# Employee-Turnover-Analytics
## Machine Learning Project - Data Science and Artificial Intelligence T5
### As part of these projects, we had an important machine learning project titled "Employee Turnover Analytics." This project focused on a problem scenario for Portobello Tech, an innovative application company that developed a smart method to predict employee turnover rates within the company. The system periodically evaluates employee work details, such as the number of projects they have worked on, average monthly working hours, time spent at the company, promotions in the last five years, and salary level. 
### The goal of this project was to use this data to identify factors contributing to employee departures and predict turnover rates.

### We implemented the programming steps using Python in Google Colab. 
### The process involved writing specific code to conduct exploratory data analysis, test hypotheses, and apply machine learning models to predict employee turnover. 
### The scenario, along with the steps and guidelines, was included in a separate file from the code solution, along with the data table used, named HR_comma_sep.
